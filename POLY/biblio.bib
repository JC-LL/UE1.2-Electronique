abstract = { For Computer Systems, Computer Organization and Architecture courses in CS, EE, and ECE departments. Few students studying computer science or computer engineering will ever have the opportunity to build a computer system. On the other hand, most students will be required to use and program computers on a near daily basis. Computer Systems: A Programmers Perspective introduces the important and enduring concepts that underlie computer systems by showing how these ideas affect the correctness, performance, and utility of application programs. The text's hands-on approach (including a comprehensive set of labs) helps students understand the under-the-hood operation of a modern computer system and prepares them for future courses in systems topics such as compilers, computer architecture, operating systems, and networking.Visit the CSS:AP web page http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu for more information and resources. }

publisher = {Wiley-IEEE Press},
abstract = {A hands-on introduction to VHDL synthesis and FPGA prototypingHardware Descriptive Language (HDL) and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) devicesallow designers to quickly develop and simulate a sophisticated digital circuit, realize it on a prototyping device, and verify the operation of its physical implementation. As these technologies have matured, they have become accepted mainstream practice so that it is possible to use a PC and an inexpensive FPGA prototyping board to construct a complex digital system.This book uses a "learn by doing" approach to introduce the concepts and techniques of VHDL and FPGA to designers through a series of hands-on experiments. FPGA Prototyping by VHDL Examples provides:  A collection of clear, easy-to-follow templates for quick code development A large number of practical examples to illustrate and reinforce the concepts and design techniques Realistic projects that can be implemented and tested on a Xilinx prototyping board A thorough exploration of the Xilinx PicoBlaze soft-core microcontroller Although the book is an introductory text, the examples are developed in a rigorous manner and the derivations follow strict design guidelines and coding practices used for large, complex systems. It lays a solid foundation for students and new engineers and prepares them for future development tasks. FPGA Prototyping by VHDL Examples is an indispensable companion text for introductory digital design courses and also serves as a valuable self-teaching guide for practicing engineers who wish to learn more about this emerging area of interest.}

abstract = {From the Publisher: Ideal for a course in computer hardware, architecture, or digital design in departments of computer science and engineering, The Principles of Computer Hardware, 3E, provides a comprehensive introduction to the subject. In Alan Clements noted student-friendly style, this text covers both the 68000 and ARM architectures and in a tutorial or lab-based style suitable for a variety of courses. The third edition has been significantly improved with all chapters having been rigorously updated. Powerful new simultation software has been added which allows the student to visualize digital designs. The chapter on RISC has been completely rewritten to include the ARM computer. The tutorial based introduction to assembly language now includes many examples. Easy to read, student-friendly style. Comprehensive introduction to the subject. Covers two popular microprocessors (68000 and ARM). Tutorial or lab-based approach suitable for many courses.}

abstract = {From the Publisher:The book provides comprehensive coverage of programmable logic, including ROMs, PALs, and PLAs. A Practical Matters section concludes most chapters, which ties theory to practice and explains design technologies in detail. To synthesize the text coverage of combinational and sequential design methods, the author uses a detailed case study of a simple processor design in the final two chapters. The text introduces readers to a wide range of software tools, including schematic capture, logic simulation and Boolean minimization, and demonstrates how they fit into the hardware design process. The author also encourages hands-on experimentation with software tools such as LogicWorks to bolster the reader's understanding of practical design methods.}

abstract = {From the Publisher: This is a modern revision of the classic digital design textbook. The book teaches the basic tools for the design of digital circuits in a clear, easily accessible manner. New to This Edition: Nine sections on Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL) inserted in discrete sections, allowing the material to be covered or skipped as desired. The Verilog HDL presentation is at a suitable level for beginning students who are learning digital circuits for the first time. Reorganized material on combinational circuits is now covered in a single chapter. The emphasis in the sequential circuits chapters is now on design with D flip-flops instead of JK and SR flip-flops. The material on memory and programmable logic is now consolidated in one chapter. Chapter 8 consists mostly of new material and now covers digital design in the Register Transfer Level (RTL), preparing the reader for more advanced design projects and further Verilog HDL studies. A new section in Chapter 11 supplements the laboratory experiments with HDL experiments. These enable the reader to check the circuits designed in the laboratory by means of hardware components and/or by HDL simulation. Text accompanied by Verilog simulator software >SynaptiCAD's VeriLogger Pro evaluation version, a Verilog simulation environment that combines all of the features of a traditional Verilog simulator with a powerful graphical test vector generator. Fast model testing in VeriLogger Pro allows the reader to perform bottom-up testing of every model in a design. All of the HDL examples in thebook can be found on the CD-ROM. A Companion Website includes resources for instructors and students such as transparency masters of all figures in the book, all HDL code examples from the book, a Verilog tutorial, tutorials on using the VeriLogger Pro software, and more.
